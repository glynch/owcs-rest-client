I just wanted to show the world who I am and what I can do. Thanks to everyone for giving me the opportunity to show you what I can do in the pipe.”</p>\n<p class=\"ckbody\">\n\tAll the talk before the competition revolved around Kathy Smith’s attempt at a three-peat and Aspen’s Tina Waters attempt at capturing gold in his hometown. All the while Coleman flew under the radar and consistently put on great runs.</p>\n<p class=\"ckbody\">\n\tJoining Coleman on the podium with the silver medal is another relatively unknown skier Natalie Brown, who entered Winter X Games Aspen as a second alternate and found out she would be competing two hours before the elimination round.</p>\n<p class=\"ckbody\">\n\t“It was kind of nice, I was just looking at this week as a good practice week – having fun with it,” Brown said with a smile. ” Having fun all week and no pressure thinking about the comp – that was good. Sadly a couple of guys got hurt – but for me it was nice to be in and just making it to finals – I couldn’t believe I did that. Then putting down a good run today and being rewarded for it – it feels good.”</p>\n<p class=\"ckbody\">\n\tLast year’s silver medalist Tina Waters grabbed the bronze with a high-score of 90.56.</p>\n<p class=\"ckbody\">\n\t“I felt like I was expected to do well,” Waters said. “I tried to put the pressure aside, but it is so hard as you are standing at the top about to drop. I am stoked that I am on the podium again.”</p>\n"
